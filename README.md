This is just a dumb sandbox for me to play around with Mongoid while I learn about MongoDB and Mongoid.

This isn't really meant to do anything, it's just a test of simple CRUD stuff (minus the U, I guess, as of this writing).

It really bothers me that I left it as "get '/delete[...]'. Like, a lot.
